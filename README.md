# Actuarize!

Actuarize is a made-up portmaneau derived from the word actuary and the suffix -ize. Through actuarial tables, an actuary can compute the probability of death based on the age and sex of a person. The suffix -ize is a derivational morpheme that changes a base word (noun or adjective) into a verb.

For our purposes, to actuarize is "to calculate the probability a person or group of people will die by a certain date".
